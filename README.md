# ofxOMXPlayerLite

Somehow... The original [ofxOMXPlayer](https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxOMXPlayer) became too heavy to use with my automated builds. This why ofxOMXPlayer**Lite**.

## Usage

I did the following. 

- Removed all examples
- Removed videos
- Removed history

What we have here is the lightest working version of ofxOMXPlayer.

You can use it as before.

```
git clone https://github.com/kr15h/ofxOMXPlayerLite,git
mv ofxOMXPlayerLite ofxOMXPlayer
```

Enjoy!
